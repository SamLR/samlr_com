Two sources of fiction for you this week.

Content note on this one for topics of pandemics and mortality. [Didnâ€™t I Write this story already? When your fictional pandemic becomes reality](https://www.tor.com/2020/04/14/didnt-i-write-this-story-already-when-your-fictional-pandemic-becomes-reality/) by Naomi Kritzer are her reflections on your speculative fiction becoming reality. Her story, [So much cooking](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/kritzer_11_15/), was written in 2015 and is a series of posts from a food blogger under quarantine during a pandemic. It's a sad and hopeful read. Both pieces are well worth your time.

Content note on this one for potentially everything (including suicide, rape etc). [GPT2 Petitions](https://elleo.github.io/petition_generator/#379) By Mike Sheldon (aka elleo) is the generative output of a neural net that's been trained on the various [petitions](https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/) submitted to the UK Government. The petitions it produces range from the obvious nonsense (like the one linked), to the much more sinister and believable. Well worth a play but be warned that, as with anything produced by a neural net trained on public content the range of views is.. concerning.
