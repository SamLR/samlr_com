Another week, some more notes. 

We've made it to December so here's a seasonally appropriate project write up: [Have yourself a matrix LED Christmas](https://medium.com/@jofranchetti/have-yourself-a-matrix-led-christmas-f25cfedede74) by Jo Franchetti. It's a nice and detailed write up of making a thing and I really enjoyed it.

Next is a long one: [Schrodinger's cab firm: Uber's existential crisis](https://www.londonreconnections.com/2019/schrodingers-cab-firm-ubers-existential-crisis/) by John Bull[[1](#footnote1)<a id="jumpback1"></a>]. This is a really in depth look at what's going on with Uber in London (they had their [license revoked last week](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-50544283), although they have some time to appeal). *[**snip** I had a couple of sentences here complaining about Uber, they weren't very good. Suffice it to say: I have significant problems with Uber's business model and believe them to be evil]*

[A tactile 3D display, created with sound](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jOnxr9Ez_Kc&feature=emb_title) is a good little video from Lizzie Gibney for Nature on an exciting piece of technology: using some speakers and a lot of computing to move a polystyrene ball as a projection surface.

Finally, another 3D fun thing: [mini-Tokyo 3D](https://nagix.github.io/mini-tokyo-3d/#14/35.6814/139.767/0/60). Nothing more really to say on that, it's a very nicely produced map with lots of information.
