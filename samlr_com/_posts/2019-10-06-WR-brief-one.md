Just one today as I've been away on holiday.

Here it is: [Plate tectonics runs deeper than we thing](https://arstechnica.com/science/2019/10/plate-tectonics-runs-deeper-than-we-thought/) By Howard Lee. I don't know if this is the best for-a-general-audience summary of the current state of geology but it's the one I found. According to this article the sate of the science has moved on since I was in school (or, more recently, when I was reading [Earth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/373572.Earth)). This is a pretty nice 2 page read and well worth it.
