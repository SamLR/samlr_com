I thought I'd put aside more stuff to today but apparently not so here it is:

[The Incredible Story of the US Army's Earth-Shaking, Off-Road Land Trains](https://www.thedrive.com/news/33645/the-incredible-story-of-the-us-armys-earth-shaking-off-road-land-trains) by Peter Holderith. Who doesn't like giant machines? I'd seen [Australian road trains](http://multichrome.blogspot.com/2012/04/australian-road-train.html) before but the LeTourneau land trains are something else: giant multi wheel-drive monsters. Unsurprisingly these things were put together to move tons of material to the hard to reach wastes of the Arctic during the cold war.
