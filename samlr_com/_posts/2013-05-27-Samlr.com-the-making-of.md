At long last this site is live. As you can see from the dates on the other blog posts I started work on this 3 months ago and I've been working pretty inconsistently since then, actually that's a lie: checking [github](https://github.com/SamLR/samlr_com/graphs/commit-activity "Commit Graphs") I started work back in January but the early posts were lorem ipsum so we don't talk about those.

So, this post is an attempt to document how this site actually runs, I've already [discussed](/posts/2013-03-07-Website.html "Website") the lovely little script that produces this site but now I'm going to talk a little about how the site itself is run. The idea is simple: I have a static site, the static site is mainly text, git is excellent at spotting changes in text and moving them about, let's use git to sync the site. This has all sorts of benefits: firstly the site is kept nicely backed up, secondly the generated/dev site is kept decoupled from the production[1] site and finally it means that all publishing is done via a simple `git push web` command when I'm ready.

The basis for this system is [Abhijit Menon-Sen's guide](http://toroid.org/ams/git-website-howto "git website: how-to") and the idea is very simple. You create a git repository on the hosting server, use the `post-receive` hook to then checkout those changes in a different directory (e.g. `/var/www` or where ever you have your server keep stuff). The hook is a script which is called when ever the server receives changes. The script Abhijit's guide suggests then forces a checkout into the `GIT_WORK_TREE` which pushes everything live.
