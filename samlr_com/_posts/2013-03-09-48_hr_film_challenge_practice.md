summary: A brief write up of our practice 48 hour film challenge

This weekend I did something stupid. 

Very stupid.

I did a 48-hour film challenge; for the uninitiated a 48 hour film challenge is a form of masochism carried out by those of us who enjoy making films. The basic premise is at the start of the 48-hours you received a set of criteria, at the end of the 48 hours you've produced a short film (normally 5 minutes) based upon those criteria. 

This may sound simple until you realise that this means in 2 days we: write a script; organise a set (or sets); costume and prop our actors; film something; edit what ever it is we've filmed and if we're *very lucky* sleep.

So, the practice didn't go quite according to plan, firstly we were late in getting a script organised, then we took a while to get to location (a lovely bit of the [Grand Union canal](http://goo.gl/maps/jO2fq "Google Maps")) and then we froze. Filming in near-zero temperatures is very unpleasant. Luckily we did get some beautiful footage (black and white makes even grotty industrial London look pretty). By 1am bits of us were threatening to fall off so we headed home to plan the next day, and how to shoot the remaining 60% of the script...

Having realised that there was no way we'd get a fully two hours of night shooting done on a Sunday (especially as we all had work on the Monday) we had a day of rapid editing and tidying up followed by a silly fight scene shot in the garden. 

There's one obvious lack from all this: the footage, well that's not been edited yet so I'll post again once I've got something to share.

**Fun Fact:** I do these things voluntarily, here are some of the previous ones I've helped with:
<dl class="dl-horizontal">
<dt>[Moonstones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm0xwJfwMzY "Youtube")</dt>
<dd>This was a 48-hr job for last year's [Sci-fi London](http://www.sci-fi-london.com/ "Sci-fi London") Challenge. It's very silly but was good fun to film</dd>
<dt>[Together](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHPpj13s71k "Youtube")</dt>
<dd>A practice filmed in *24* hours, (edited in many more though). We had 5 of us in a tiny house, I even ended up acting in this one!</dd>
<dt>[The Showreel](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-clEEAAw_a8 "Youtube")</dt>
<dd>Done for the [48 Hr Film Project](http://www.48hourfilm.com/ "48 hour film project") this was supposed to be simple, it didn't end up like that...</dd>
<dt>[The Butterfly System](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IFeG4GvkPEA "Youtube")</dt>
<dd>Another [Sci-fi London](http://www.sci-fi-london.com/ "Sci-fi London") entry for this one we got to shoot in the beautiful [Kew Bridge Steam Museum](http://kbsm.org "KBSM"). This may not make sense but it is pretty.</dd>
<dt>[The Silver Pool](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ8H5WPZx6c "Youtube")</dt>
<dd>This was the first short I was involved in (also for [Sci-fi London](http://www.sci-fi-london.com/ "Sci-fi London")), annoyingly this edit misses some of our best scenes, one day I'll re-do it.</dd>
