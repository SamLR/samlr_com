I've been having a week (colleagues over for 4 days of meetings) so only one article for y'all: [Ironies of Automation](https://blog.acolyer.org/2020/01/08/ironies-of-automation/) by Adrian Colyer. Every day Adrian publishes a write up of a academic article related to computer science as "The Morning Paper". Unsurprisingly many are pretty in-depth but Wednesday's is actually from industrial systems design. It covers the "Irony of Automation": that the more a process is automated the more skill is required to deal with the circumstances outside of those expected by the automation. Given the massive, computer driven, increase in automation over the 37 years since this was written it's definitely worth a read.
