A little two-fer today before I head off to try and actually do some work for next year's [Electromagnetic Field](https://www.emfcamp.org/).

PSA first: if you live in the UK we have a general election coming up. You have until Tuesday November 26th (i.e. two day's time) to [register to vote](https://www.gov.uk/register-to-vote). If you're unsure if you can vote article the first has got you: [a definitive list of everyone who can vote in the UK general election](http://gal-dem.com/a-definitive-list-of-everyone-who-can-vote-in-the-uk-general-election/) by Micha Frazer-Carroll. I've not fact-checked this but it chimes with what I know and is a lot clearer than the notes on the [gov.uk](https://gov.uk) site. Basically any UK or Irish citizens (the latter living in the UK I believe) can vote. 

Next article is this write up on [turning photos into 2.5D parallax animations with machine learning](https://waxy.org/2019/11/turning-photos-into-2-5d-parallax-animations-with-machine-learning/) by Andy Baio. It's a pretty short write up but generally interesting but the best bit is the [Google colab notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XcDFtte7KpI8Q3w90-mAd1qSFMkKFEpt) which allows you to run it all on Google's servers and play around (although it takes several minutes to initialise it all). Here's a quick thing I did with it:
