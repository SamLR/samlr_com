Two picks for this week (another busy one so not been reading as much). 

[I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb](https://www.vice.com/amp/en_us/article/43k7z3/nationwide-fake-host-scam-on-airbnb?__twitter_impression=true) by Allie Conti is an interesting read on a group of scammers who operate on AirBnB. The story is very low to the ground but really illustrates how any system ends up with parasites; especially one as successful as AirBnB. It's a real shame how weak their response is to what seems like a pretty damning report.

[The Nottingham Hackspace will close...](https://www.bricolage.run/blog/2019/10/31/the-nottingham-hackspace-will-close) by Dominic Morrow is a bit of a sad read looking at the future of Nottingham Hackspace. Hopefully they'll find a way forward but I've got to thank Dominic for highlighting the problems they're facing so, if nothing else, they can hopefully help others.
