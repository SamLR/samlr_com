I'm sure I had more for this week but I can't find them so I'll have to wrangle them for the next one as it's late (I may have lost track of time playing [The Return of the Obra Dinn](https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/) which you should definitely play).

**Content note**: discussion of suicide, depression and related things. [5 Things suicide loss survivors should know - from someone who's attempted](https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/losing-someone-to-suicide) by Sam Dylan Finch. This was a tough read, I've had several bouts of suicidal ideation and completely understand a lot of what's being said here. Definitely worth reading if you have the brain space for it as it does a good job of unpacking some of the complex emotions (that some people) have during suicidal periods.

Opposite end of the scale now: [20 photos of Trans Elders who have survived](https://www.advocate.com/photography/2018/9/06/20-photos-trans-elders-who-have-survived-jess-t-dugan) by Jess T. Dugan, this is just lovely. All too often trans conversations focus on the young so it's awesome to see a well curated gallery of elders utterly rocking it.

Last up is a long one: [Super Position](https://thenewinquiry.com/super-position/) by David Graeber. This is an interesting read on fascism in comics but a lot deeper than the standard "Batman's a fascist". The main thing I took from this was actually to do with fascism's relationship with creativity and the urge to control it. That being said this was a heavy one so I should probably read it again myself.
