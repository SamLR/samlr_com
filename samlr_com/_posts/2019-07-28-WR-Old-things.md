Hello! This week's reading are.... old things (mostly).

First we have [The Wonderful Barn](https://telescoper.wordpress.com/2019/07/26/the-wonderful-barn/) by Peter Coles, AKA [telescoper](https://twitter.com/telescoper), it's not an in depth write up but it is a fascinating curio and I love finding out about this sort of thing.

I also really enjoyed was ["These 4 Ancient Apocalypses Changed the Course of Civilization"](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2019/07/26/ancient-apocalypses-doggerland-thera-thonis-hekla-3) by [Paul Cooper](https://twitter.com/PaulMMCooper) (who you should definitely follow for his threads on history & archaeology). Whilst I've been aware of all 4 from various sources it was great to see then collected and considered together. If you enjoyed this one I would also recommend Paul's article on [Caligula's pleasure barges](http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2018/11/07/caligula-mussolini-lake-nemi-floating-pleasure-palaces/).

Finally yesterday we had our first EMP: a short evening meet up to get people excited for [Electromagnetic Field 2020](emfcamp.org) and my friend, Alia, demoed her initial edit of the footage she shot at the previous EMF. [It's beautiful; watch it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afpPLcxFB54)
