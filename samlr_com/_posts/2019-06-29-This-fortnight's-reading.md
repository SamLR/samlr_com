So the weekly thing is tough but here's something I really enjoyed reading these last two weeks: 

[How the UK transformed its electricity supply in just a decade](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/how-uk-transformed-electricity-supply-decade/) by Simon Evans (analysis) and Rosamund Pearce (interactive).

It's a long form essay looking at the last 11 years of energy production and policy in the UK. The interactive bits generally work well and nicely compliment the text: giving add context and visualisations of the details without getting in the way or being overly flashy.

It's really interesting to see how renewables have gone from <10% of energy in 2008 to nearly 50% now. It's also fun to gauge how much of this was because or despite of government policy.

The article feels a little light on the impact of various policies but it's an excellent history of the attempted interventions and changes.
