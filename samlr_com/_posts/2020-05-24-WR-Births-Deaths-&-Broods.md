Lets try and get this out actually during the day for the first time in a while...

[Millions of Cicadas Are Set to Emerge After Developing for 17 Years Underground](https://www.newsweek.com/millions-cicadas-17-years-underground-1505461) by Rosie McCall. Happy spawning, Brood IX! Cicadas' multi-year breeding cycles are fascinating although I'm sure it's less fun if your neighbourhood is suddenly very loud and full of cicada [exuvia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exuvia).

[Stork chicks hatch in UK for first time in 600 years – why that’s great news for British wildlife](https://theconversation.com/stork-chicks-hatch-in-uk-for-first-time-in-600-years-why-thats-great-news-for-british-wildlife-137320) by Alexander C. Lees. Talking of long time absentees... Bird watching is a hobby of mine so I'm always happy to hear news about birds and this is some great news. Once its safe to go visiting places again I may make a trip to see these lovely birds.

[Organ donation law in England has changed](https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/uk-laws/organ-donation-law-in-england/) by NHS[[1](#footnote1)<a id="jumpback1"></a>] continuing the theme of good news for the UK: organ donation is now opt-out. This is one of those changes that should have a really big impact on people's health. The availability of organs for donation is a big problem and making it opt-out should improve that. Here's hoping.

[On Edward Jenner](https://mobile.twitter.com/sjmelchor/status/1263174936786538498) by [@sjmelchor](https://twitter.com/sjmelchor). This is an interesting and important detail of the history of vaccination that I think should be more widely known.

[Footprints capture a lakeside stroll by a group of ancient hunter-gatherers](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/05/footprints-record-a-snapshot-of-life-in-ancient-tanzania/) by Kiona N. Smith. Going a bit further back in our history to finish off. There're obviously a lot of assumptions underpinning the description of the "stroll" (not least that current hunter-gatherers are a reasonable model) but this does a good job of looking at them.
