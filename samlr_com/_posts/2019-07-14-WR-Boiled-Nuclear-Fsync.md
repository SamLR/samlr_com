Going to start trying to prefix these blogs with "WR". Lets see how that goes...

Article numero-uno is one that I'd wanted to include last week but couldn't remember the link for but now I have it: John Bull (AKA [@garius](https://twitter.com/garius)) on [boiling frogs](https://medium.com/@garius/the-politics-of-boiling-frogs-85362cee4228). I always enjoy Garius' sarcastic thoughts on history and politics (I backed his book [The Brexit Tapes](https://unbound.com/books/the-brexit-tapes/)). Anyway this was a fun look at the state of the Tory party leadership contest as of 2 weeks ago.

With politics out of the way on to a pair of twitter threads about nuclear safety and particle physics (one linked to the other). From [@annieminoff](https://twitter.com/annieminoff/status/1147610078868123649) there is a thread on the [AGLAE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acc%C3%A9l%C3%A9rateur_Grand_Louvre_d%27analyse_%C3%A9l%C3%A9mentaire) H/He accelerator. The other tweet, from [@XMPPwocky](https://twitter.com/XMPPwocky/status/1148152405915131904), links the IAEA report on a nuclear accident in Nesvizh. I've not read the full report but it's full of fascinating pictures and diagrams (CONTENT NOTE between pages 36 & 41 there are pictures of the injuries caused by the accident).

Last but not least is this write up, by Dan Luu, of a talk he gave "[Deconstruct files](https://danluu.com/deconstruct-files/)" which covers why safely writing a file to disk is hard. As with everything in computers its a combination of leaky abstractions; inconsistent specifications and trade-offs.
