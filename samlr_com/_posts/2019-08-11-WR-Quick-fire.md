Whole lot of quick references this week. Mostly because I read most of these 2 weeks ago and forgot to update this. 

Also I'm looking for more not-men to read so if you have any suggestions please [tweet me them](https://twitter.com/sam_cook).

Anyway, here's a few things that've interested me over the last couple of weeks:

* [Intellectual Debt](https://blog.usejournal.com/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c) by Jonathan Zittrain. The core of the argument seems to be that AI represents a big risk because it drives towards solutions without necessarily why they work. It's a well written piece and breaks the argument down nicely.
* [Cities Skylines is Turing complete](https://medium.com/@balidani/cities-skylines-is-turing-complete-e5ccf75d1c3a) by Daniel Bali, continues the internet's drive to implement a computer in anything.
* [gov.uk's oldest sites](https://gist.github.com/Jonty/3e392ca2c932a9bc423a697ca3bc77a9) something from my friend, Jonty: a list of the oldest sites on the .gov.uk domain, as recorded by archive.com. Worth it just to time machine back to a time when the internet was bright and full of hope
* [Decades-Old computer science conjecture solved in two pages](https://www.quantamagazine.org/mathematician-solves-computer-science-conjecture-in-two-pages-20190725/) by Erica Klarreich, a good write up of an interesting proof.
