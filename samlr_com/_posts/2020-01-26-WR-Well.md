Bit of a grim start today but there is some more upbeat stuff. At the end. Sorry, I've had a tough week so you get a tough read. 

[State of the World 2020](https://people.well.com/conf/inkwell.vue/topics/507/State-of-the-World-2020-Bruce-St-page01.html) from Bruce Sterling and Jon Lebkowsky (and others) at the Well. This is a big (I've only finished the first page) grim read. Every year Bruce & Jon have a "State of the World" thread on The Well and it's always worth reading. This one is no exception but it ain't happy.

[The attack on Exarchia, an anarchist refuge in Athens](https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-attack-on-exarchia-an-anarchist-refuge-in-athens) by Molly Crabapple. Molly gives a first hand view inside Exarchia that was and what is happening to it now. Sadly most of what is happening to the to the people there is fascist violence.

[Contempt Culture](https://blog.aurynn.com/2015/12/16-contempt-culture) by Aurynn. A few years old but Aurynn's careful look at contempt culture is always worth revisiting. Whilst this focuses on developer communities contempt culture can be a problem in any group of people and it's well worth being on guard against.

[A new life: being diagnosed with ADHD in my 40s has given me something quite magical](https://www.theguardian.com/society/commentisfree/2020/jan/15/a-new-life-being-diagnosed-with-adhd-in-my-40s-has-given-me-something-quite-magical) by Jason Wilson. A bit happier now. Jason gives a first hand account of the effect on his life of receiving his ADHD diagnosis.

[The most complete brain map ever is here: a fly's "connectome"](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/01/the-most-complete-brain-map-ever-is-here-a-flys-connectome/) by Gregory Barber. SCIENCE! Not had some science here for a fair bit. Whilst mapping a human brain is still a long way off this represents a pretty significant step forward. Partly because this should be a good item of research in and of itself but also because it provides a known good data set for testing new techniques on.

[Reverberations](https://www.linusakesson.net/music/reverberations/) by Linus Ã…kesson. Rounding out this week, I really enjoyed this set of classic organ pieces performed and synthesised on Commodore 64 to sound like actual church organs.
