So it's that time of year again: [Sci-Fi London time](www.sci-fi-london.com "Sci Fi London") which of course means that the actual festival is in a couple of weeks (24th April - 4th May to be precise) but this weekend was their annual 48hr film challenge. Once again team Tortoise Butler braved (further) insanity, caffeine-overdose and friendships to produce a short film; and this years is the best yet.

If you're not in the know a 48 hr film challenge is a competition where you are given:
<dl>
  <dt>Title:</dt><dd> "Leadtime"</dd>
  <dt>Line of dialogue:</dt><dd> "It's naturally bitter, so obviously... I first thought of you."</dd>
  <dt>Prop:</dt><dd> "Headset - we see a character with ear/headphones on, then take them off")</dd>
</dl>
With those in hand you have 48hrs to produce a short film (less than 5 minutes). To be clear when we say 'produce' we mean the entire thing: we had a location, people and the equipment. Everything else: the script, the lighting, the editing, the sound, the effects, all of these was made in the 48 hours.

So without further ado here's what we made:
