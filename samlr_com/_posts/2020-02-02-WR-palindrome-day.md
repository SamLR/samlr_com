First up: happy 3-way palindrome day, regardless of which way you like to write the date (mm/dd/yyyy, dd/mm/yyyy or yyyy-mm-dd[[1](#footnote1)<a id="jumpback1"></a>]) today you can read it the same way back and forth. Apparently it's going to be a while (at a guess 1010 years, 1 month and a day) before this is true for all 3 formats again. Anyway, on to the articles.

[The New Video of One of the Scariest Places on Earth](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/01/watch-video-one-worlds-most-important-places/605731/) by Robinson Meyer. A bit of a naff title but the article does a great job of giving context to a really fascinating piece of research being done of the Thwaites Glacier in Antarctica. The video is underwhelming for itself but when you realise you're seeing the underside of nearly 600m of ice.

[Here Are the Most Common Airbnb Scams Worldwide](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/epgvm7/airbnb-scam-how-to-tell) by Anna Merlan. A follow up to 'I Accidentally Uncovered a Nationwide Scam on Airbnb' ([callback!](/posts/2019-11-03-WR-Hacking-airbnb.html)), not as interesting as the original but if you use Airbnb at all you'll want to read it.

Anyway I'm feeling ill and wanted to design a hook for my headphones so I'll see you next week.
