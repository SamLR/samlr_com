You may or may not know of Allen Watts (a British philosopher) but if you listen to electronica (or any related music) you've probably heard him speak. I certainly have, a lot. This lovely article, [the appropriation of Alan Watts in contemporary electronic music](https://www.djbroadcast.net/article/126448/the-appropriation-of-alan-watts-in-contemporary-electronic-music), from Dan Cole explains why. Thanks to [@russss](https://twitter.com/russss) for pointing me at it after my complaining about Alan's constant presence in Spotify's recommendations.

Next an interesting bit of history/trivia: [Entertaining Training: Usability Guidance Built into Solitaire, FreeCell & Minesweeper](https://99percentinvisible.org/article/entertained-or-trained-subtle-lessons-built-into-solitaire-minesweeper/) by Kurt Kohlstedt. Which is a brief story about why Microsoft added Solitare and Minesweeper to their operating systems.
