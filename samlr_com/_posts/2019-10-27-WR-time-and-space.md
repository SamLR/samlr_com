Only one today [Harmonic Polyrhythms Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCJHNBEdoc) by [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ). A friend linked me this and it's well worth a watch. It's nominally from a series on how to play the bass but this is a really interesting look at polyrhythms and how they correspond to harmonies. It's 8minutes long and fascinating.

Anyway, will try to have more for y'all next week.
