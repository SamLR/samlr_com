Only one today [Harmonic Polyrhythms Explained!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gCJHNBEdoc) by [Adam Neely](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnkp4xDOwqqJD7sSM3xdUiQ). A friend linked me this and it's well worth a watch. It's nominally from a series on how to play the bass but this is a really interesting look at polyrhythms and how they correspond to harmonies. It's 8minutes long and fascinating.

Anyway, will try to have more for y'all next week.

**Edited to add** the other thing that's worth reading this week is [Hackers steal secret crypto keys for NordVPN. Hereâ€™s what we know so far](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2019/10/hackers-steal-secret-crypto-keys-for-nordvpn-heres-what-we-know-so-far/) from Dan Goodin at Ars Technica. Mostly flagging this as I use NordVPN and I'll likely be changing that soon given the contents of this report.
