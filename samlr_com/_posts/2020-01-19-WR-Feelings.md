One article today.

[A crash course in having feelings](https://www.drmaciver.com/2020/01/a-crash-course-in-having-feelings/) by David MacIver. This is an excellent write up about using various CBT and mindfulness techniques to diagnose feelings as well as how to deal with them. 

It's been another long week so I'm going to leave this here but will hopefully have more for next week.
