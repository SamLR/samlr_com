A couple of things I found today.

Content note for millipedes [Bizarre new species discovered... on Twitter](https://phys.org/news/2020-05-bizarre-species-twitter.html) by University of Copenhagen. New finds can be made in all sorts of places. 

[Sounding the Sumburgh Foghorn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHCmzvzCmhI) filmed by JJ Jamieson (audio by Alex Jamieson). This short video shows the Sumburgh foghorn, restored by Brian Johnson, being powered up and sounding, it's rather lovely.

And that's it because I'm sleepy and un-inspired today, sorry.
