Evening, bit of a late start writing this one (only an hour of Sunday left) but I've been in the shed finishing some projects. Hopefully have some pictures once they are finally finished; I may even write something up. Two articles today, both with an unintentional oceanic theme.

[The real Lord of the Flies: what happened when six boys were shipwrecked for 15 months](https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/09/the-real-lord-of-the-flies-what-happened-when-six-boys-were-shipwrecked-for-15-months) by Rutger Bregman. You've likely seen this one as it's been doing the rounds but if you've previously skipped it then I'd recommend giving it another look. If only to have some further evidence that people are much better than [""elite panic](https://boingboing.net/2013/04/14/elite-panic-why-rich-people-t.html) would have you think.

[Thirty-six Thousand Feet
Under the Sea](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/05/18/thirty-six-thousand-feet-under-the-sea) by Ben Taub. A long read this one but if you enjoy exploration this story of taking a submersible to the deepest points of all five oceans is worth it. It very much lionises Victor Vescovo as the driving force of the expedition, which I find annoying in what's obviously the result of a huge team (although it does make a better story etc. etc.). Storytelling style annoyances aside this gave me some lovely wiki-holes to dive into.
